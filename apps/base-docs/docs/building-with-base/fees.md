# Fees

## Understanding Network Fees on Base

Each Base transaction incurs two types of costs: an L2 (execution) fee and an L1(security) fee. 
L2 Execution Fee covers the cost of processing your transaction on Layer 2 (L2).
L1 Security fee reflects the estimated cost to record the transaction on Layer 1 (L1).
This fee is generally higher than the L2 execution fee.

L1 fees vary based on network activity on Layer 1. During periods of high demand, fees increase; 
during quieter times (e.g., weekends), fees tend to decrease. 
If your transaction timing is flexible, submitting during lower-demand periods can help reduce costs.

Similar to L1 fees, L2 fees fluctuate depending on transaction volume on Layer 2.
The adjustment mechanism is aligned with the Ethereum EIP-1559 fee structure; learn more about it
